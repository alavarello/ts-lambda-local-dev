## Example Configuration for IDEs
These configurations assume you have your `local.server.ts` file under `src/script/` directory. You can change the path to your own location.

### VSCode
* copy the `launch.json` to your `.vscode/` directory if it doesn't exist
* otherwise add the config json into your existing `launch.json`.

### JetBrains(IntelliJ/WebStorm)
* place the `local-server.run.xml` file into your `.run/` directory then it should appear in your IDE's `run configuration` section.
